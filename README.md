# last-checkpoint

I'm excited about the idea of taking on new challenges and growing in different ways. I can't wait to see what the future holds for me and all the opportunities I will be taking on. I'm always learning and improving on my self. Thanks to ongoing updates and feedback from u

I've gotten good at sharing thoughts and ideas with people. I learnt how to communicate and collaborate with people as a team. Also, I learnt how to source for information and do more research to better myself. I also learnt time management and how to do tasks within specific timeframes. I had a good experiernce overall.
